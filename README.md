This is a simple script to extend your phone as a external monitor. 
Make sure you have the following apps installed
### In Linux

### In Android
- [VNC Viewer](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.realvnc.viewer.android%26hl%3Den)

Download the script files that you want then copy the file to `/usr/local/bin` or your preferred location.
Then make the script executable by using chmod
```
chmod +x extend-monitor-right.sh
chmod +x extend-monitor-right-adb.sh
```

Make sure you have the script location in your path for your shell to gloablly access the script.
